Dynamic Fare Calculation (Current Rates)
Monday Pricing (2025-08-19 15:34:15 UTC)
The system automatically applies weekday rates on Monday with no weekend surcharge:

Java
// Current fare calculation for Monday
public static double calculateFare(double distance, String busType, double baseFare) {
    double fare = baseFare;
    
    // Distance surcharges
    if (distance > 100) {
        fare += (distance - 100) * 2.5; // Rs. 2.5 per km after 100km
    } else if (distance > 50) {
        fare += (distance - 50) * 1.5;  // Rs. 1.5 per km after 50km
    }
    
    // Bus type multipliers
    switch (busType.toLowerCase()) {
        case "luxury": fare *= 1.6; break;  // 60% premium
        case "ac": fare *= 1.35; break;     // 35% premium
        case "normal": fare *= 1.0; break; // Base price
    }
    
    // Monday: No weekend surcharge applied
    
    return Math.round(fare * 100.0) / 100.0;
}
